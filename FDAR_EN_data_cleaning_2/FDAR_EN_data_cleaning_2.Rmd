# Introduction

In the previous lesson, we learned a range of functions for diagnosing data issues. Now, let's focus on some common techniques and functions for fixing those issues. Let's get started!

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand how to clean column names, both automatically and manually.
-   Effectively eliminate duplicate entries.
-   Correct and fix string values in your data.

# Packages

Load the following packages for this lesson:

```{r warning = F, message = F, echo = F}
# Load packages 
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,
               janitor,
               inspectdf)
```

# Dataset

The dataset we will be using for this lesson is a slightly modified version of the dataset we used in the first `Data Cleaning` lesson; here, we've added slightly more errors to clean! Check out lesson 1 for an explanation of this dataset.

```{r message=FALSE}
non_adherence <- read_csv(here("data/non_adherence_messy.csv"))
```

```{r render = reactable_5_rows}
non_adherence
```

# Cleaning column names

As a general rule, column names should have a "clean", standardized syntax so that we can easily work with them and so that our code is readable to other coders.

Ideally, column names:

-   should be short
-   should have no spaces or periods(space and periods should be replaced by underscore "\_")
-   should have no unusual characters(&, #, \<, \>)
-   should have a similar style

To check out our column names, we can use the `names()` function from base R.

```{r}
names(non_adherence)
```

Here we can see that:

-   some names contain spaces
-   some names contain special characters such as `...`
-   some names are in upper case while some are not

## Automatic column name cleaning with `janitor::clean_names()`

A handy function for standardizing column names is the `clean_names()` from the `janitor` {janitor} package. The function `clean_names()` converts all names to consist of only underscores, numbers, and letters, using the snake case style.

```{r}
non_adherence %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  names()
```

From this output, we can see that:

-   upper case variable names were converted to lower case (e.g., `EDUCATION_OF_PATIENT` is now `education_of_patient`)

-   spaces inside the variable names have been converted to underscores (e.g., `Age at ART initiation` is now `age_at_art_initiation`)

-   periods(`.`) have all been replaced by underscores (e.g., `Civil...status` is now `civil_status`)

Let's save this cleaned dataset as `non_adherence_clean`.

```{r}
non_adherence_clean <- 
  non_adherence %>%
  clean_names()
non_adherence_clean
```

### Q: Automatic cleaning {.unlisted .unnumbered}

*(NOTE: Answers are at the bottom of the page. Try to answer the questions yourself before checking.)*

The following dataset has been adapted from a study that used retrospective data to characterize the tmporal and spatial dynamics of typhoid fever epidemics in Kasene, Uganda.

```{r}
typhoid <- read_csv(here("data/typhoid_uganda.csv"))
```

Use the `clean_names()` function from `janitor` to clean the variables names in the `typhoid` dataset.
:::

## {stringr} and `dplyr::rename_with()` for renaming columns

To make more manual changes to column names, you should already know how to use the `rename()` function from the `dplyr` package. However, this function requires you to specify the old and new column names. This can be tedious if you have many columns to rename.

An alternative is to use the `rename_with()` function from the `dplyr` package. This function allows you to apply a function to all column names. For example, if we want to convert all column names to upper case, we can use the `toupper()` function inside `rename_with()`.

```{r}
non_adherence_clean %>%
  rename_with(.cols = everything(), .fn = toupper)

# We can also omit the .cols argument, which defaults to everything()
non_adherence_clean %>%
  rename_with(.fn = toupper)
```

But of course, this is not a recommended name style. Let's try something more useful. In the `non_adherence` dataset, some of the column names end with `_of_patient`. This is not necessary, as we know that all the variables are of the patient. We can use the `str_replace_all()` function from the `stringr` package to remove the `_of_patient` from all column names.

Here is the syntax for `str_replace_all()`:

```{r}
test_string <- "this is a test string"
str_replace_all(string = test_string, pattern = "test", replacement = "new")
```

It has three arguments, `string`, the string to be modified, `pattern`, the pattern to be replaced, and `replacement`, the new pattern to replace the old pattern.

Let's apply this to our column names.

```{r render = reactable_5_rows}
non_adherence_clean_2 <- 
  non_adherence_clean %>%
  # manually re-name columns
  rename_with(str_replace_all, pattern = "_of_patient", replacement = "")

non_adherence_clean_2
```

That looks great! We'll use this dataset with the clean columns in the next section.

::: side-note
In the cleaning examples in this lesson, we are assigning a lof of intermediate objects, such as `non_adherence_clean` and `non_adherence_clean_2`. This is not usually necessary; we are doing it here for the sake of clarity in the tutorial. In your own code, you will typically combine multiple cleaning steps into a single pipe chain:

```{r eval = F}
non_adherence_clean <- 
  non_adherence %>%
  # cleaning step 1 %>% 
  # cleaning step 2 %>%
  # cleaning step 3 %>%
  # and so on
```

### Q: Complete cleaning of column names {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Standardize the column names in the `typhoid` dataset with `clean_names()` then;

-   replace `or_` with `_`

-   replace `of` with `_`

# Removing Duplicate Rows

Duplicated rows in datasets can occur due to multiple data sources or survey responses. It's essential to identify and remove these duplicates for accurate analysis.

Use `janitor::get_dupes()` to quickly identify duplicate rows. This function helps you visually inspect duplicates before removal. For example:

```{r render=reactable_10_rows}
non_adherence_clean_2 %>% 
  get_dupes()
```

This output shows duplicated rows, identifiable by common variables like `patient_id`.

After identifying duplicates, use `dplyr::distinct()` to remove them, keeping only the unique rows. For instance:

```{r}
# Before removal
nrow(non_adherence_clean_2)

# Removing duplicates
non_adherence_distinct <- non_adherence_clean_2 %>% 
  distinct()

# After removal
nrow(non_adherence_distinct)
```

We can see that the number of rows has decreased, indicating the removal of duplicates. We can check this by using `get_dupes()` again:

```{r}
non_adherence_distinct %>% 
  get_dupes()
```

### Q: Removing duplicates {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Identify the duplicates in the `typhoid` dataset using `get_dupes()`, then remove them using `distinct()`.

# Homogenize strings

You may remember that with the `skim` output from the first data cleaning pipeline lesson, we had instances where our string characters were inconstent regarding capitalization. For example, for our `occupation` variable, we had both `Professor` and `professor`:

```{r}
non_adherence_distinct %>% 
  count(occupation, name = "Count") %>% 
  arrange(-str_detect(occupation, "rofessor")) # to show the professor rows first
```

In order to address this, we can transform our character columns to a specific case. Here we will use title case, since that looks better on graphics and reports.

```{r render=reactable_5_rows}
non_adherence_case_corrected <- 
  non_adherence_distinct %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = c(sex, age_35, education, occupation, civil_status), 
                .fns = ~ str_to_title(.x))) #

```

If we count the number of unique levels for the `occupation` variable, we can see that we have reduced the number of unique levels from 49 to 47:

```{r}
non_adherence_case_corrected %>% 
  count(occupation, name = "Count")
```

As we can see, we have gone from 51 to 49 unique levels for the `occupation` variable.

Transform all the strings in the `typhoid` dataset to lowercase.

# `dplyr::case_match()` for String Cleaning

For more bespoke string cleaning, we can use the `case_match()` function from the {dplyr} package. This function allows us to specify a series of conditions and values to be applied to a vector.

Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use `case_match()`:

```{r}
test_vector <- c("+", "-", "NA", "missing")
case_match(test_vector, 
           "+" ~ "Positive", 
           "-" ~ "Negative", 
           .default = "Other")
```

As you can see, the `case_match()` function takes a vector as its first argument, followed by a series of conditions and values. The `.default` argument is optional and specifies the value to be returned if none of the conditions are met.

We'll apply this first on the `sex` column in the `non_adherence_distinct` dataset. First, observe the levels in this variable:

```{r}
non_adherence_case_corrected %>% count(sex, name = "Count")
```

In this variable, we can see that there are inconsistencies in the way the levels have been coded. Let's use the `case_match()` function so that `F` is changed to `Female`.

```{r}
non_adherence_case_corrected %>%
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, "F" ~ "Female", .default = sex)) %>% 
  count(sex, name = "Count")
```

The utility is more obvious when you have a lot of values to change. For example, let's make the following modifications on the occupation column:

-   Replace "Worker" with "Laborer"
-   Replace "Housewife" with "Homemaker"
-   Replace "Truck Driver" and "Taxi Driver" with "Driver"

```{r}
non_adherence_recoded <- 
  non_adherence_case_corrected %>%
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, "F" ~ "Female", .default = sex)) %>% 
  mutate(occupation = case_match(occupation, 
                                 "Worker" ~ "Laborer", 
                                 "Housewife" ~ "Homemaker", 
                                 "Truck Driver" ~ "Driver", 
                                 "Taxi Driver" ~ "Driver", 
                                 .default = occupation))
```

::: watch-out
If you don't specify the `.default=column_name` argument then all of the values in that column that don't match the ones those you are changing and explicitly mentioned in your `case_match()` function will be returned as `NA`.

### Q: Fixing strings {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The variable `householdmembers` from the `typhoid` dataset should represent the number of individuals in a household. There is a value `01-May` in this variable. Recode this value to `1-5`.
