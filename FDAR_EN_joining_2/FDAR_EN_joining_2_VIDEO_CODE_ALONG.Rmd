# Introduction

Now that we have a solid grasp on the different types of joins and how they work, we can look at how to manage messier and more complex datasets. Joining real-world data from different sources often requires a bit of thought and cleaning ahead of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

-   You know how to check for mismatched values between dataframes

-   You understand how to join using a one-to-many match

-   You know how to join on multiple key columns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Packages

‣ Load the packages needed for this lesson using the code provided below:

```{r}
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(___________, ___________)
```

## Pre-join data cleaning: addressing data inconsistencies

‣ Often, data from **different sources** require pre-cleaning before joining.

‣ Reasons include: - Spelling errors - Differences in capitalization - Extra spaces

‣ To join values successfully, they must **match perfectly** in R.

## A toy example

‣ Let's use our mock patient data from the first lesson.

‣ Notice the different name formats in the `demographic` and `test_info` datasets.

```{r}
demographic <- tribble(
  ~name,     ~age,
  "Alice",    25,
  "Bob",      32,
  "Charlie",  45,
)
demographic
```

```{r}
test_info <- tribble(
  ~name,  ~test_date,    ~result,
  "alice", "2023-06-05",  "Negative",
  "Bob",   "2023-08-10",  "Positive",
  "charlie","2023-05-02",  "Negative",
)
test_info
```

‣ Now let's join the two datasets.

```{r}
left_join(___________, ___________, ___________)
```

```{r}
inner_join(___________, ___________, ___________)
```

‣ The joins are not perfect due to the case differences in names.

‣ Solution: Convert all names to title case using `str_to_title()`.

```{r}
test_info_title <- test_info %>%
  mutate(name = str_to_title(___________)) #converts to title case
```

```{r}
left_join(___________, ___________, ___________)
```

```{r}
inner_join(___________, ___________, ___________)
```

### Q: Inner Join countries {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The following two datasets contain data for India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. However an `inner_join()` of these datasets produces no output. What are the differences between the values in the key columns that would have to be changed before joining the datasets?

```{r}
df1 <- tribble(
  ~Country,     ~Capital,
  "India",      "New Delhi",
  "Indonesia",  "Jakarta",
  "Philippines", "Manila"
)

df2 <- tribble(
  ~Country,     ~Population,   ~Life_Expectancy,
  "India ",      1393000000,   69.7,
  "indonesia",   273500000,    71.7,
  "Philipines",  113000000,    72.7
)

inner_join(df1, df2)
```

## Real Data Example 1: Key Typos

‣ Working with small datasets makes it easy to spot key discrepancies

‣ But, how about dealing with larger datasets?

‣ Let's explore this with two real-world datasets on TB in India

‣ The first dataset: TB notifications in 2022 for all 36 Indian states and Union Territories

‣ Source: [Government of India Tuberculosis Report](https://data.gov.in/catalog/india-tuberculosis-report-2023)

```{r}
tb_notifs <- read_csv(here("data/notif_TB_india_modified.csv"))

tb_notifs_public <- tb_notifs %>% 
  filter(__________ == "public") %>% #we want only public systems for now
  select(______________)

tb_notifs_public
```

‣ The second dataset: COVID screening among TB cases for 36 Indian states

‣ Also taken from the same [TB Report](https://data.gov.in/catalog/india-tuberculosis-report-2023)

```{r}
covid_screening <- read_csv(here("data/COVID_india_modified.csv")) 

covid_screening_public <- covid_screening %>% 
  filter(__________ == "________") %>% #we want only public systems for now
  select(______________)

covid_screening_public
```

‣ Objective: Join these datasets to calculate the percentage of TB patients in each state who tested positive for COVID-19

‣ Let's attempt an `inner_join()`:

```{r}
tb_notifs_and_covid_screening <- 
  inner_join(____________, _____________)

tb_notifs_and_covid_screening
```

‣ Next, perform the percentage calculation:

```{r}
tb_notifs_and_covid_screening %>% 
  mutate(pct_covid_pos = 100 * ______ / ______) 
```

‣ Observation: We now only have 32 rows instead of 36. Why?

‣ There are "key typos" causing mismatches during the join

‣ Key Typos: Spelling/formatting inconsistencies in key columns across datasets

‣ Example: One dataset lists "New Delhi" while the other lists "Delhi"

‣ These inconsistencies prevent proper matching and result in data loss

::: vocab
**VOCAB TIME !**

‣ "Key": Column(s) used to match rows across datasets in a join

‣ "Key Typos": Spelling or formatting inconsistencies in key columns across datasets
:::

## Identifying unmatched values with `setdiff()`

‣ We want to **identify key typos** in our data

‣ For this, we can use the `setdiff()` function

‣ Let's start by comparing the `state` values from two dataframes: `tb_notifs_public` and `covid_screening_public`

```{r}
setdiff(______, ______)
```

‣ By putting the `tb_notifs_public` dataset first, we ask:

‣ "Which values are in `tb_notifs_public` but *not* in `covid_screening_public`?"

‣ We should also check the reverse order:

‣ "Which values are in `covid_screening_public` but *not* in `tb_notifs_public`?"

```{r}
setdiff(______, ______)
```

‣ We found values in `covid_screening_public` that have spelling errors or are written differently than in `tb_notifs_public`

‣ Let's clean up `covid_screening_public` using `case_when()`

```{r}
covid_screening_public_clean <- covid_screening_public %>% 
  mutate(state = 
           case_when(_________________________, 
                     _________________________, 
                     _________________________, 
                     _________________________,
                     TRUE ~ state))

setdiff(______, ______) 
setdiff(______, ______)
```

‣ Now, we have no differences in the region's names

‣ We can join our datasets:

```{r, render = reactable_5_rows}
inner_join(________________, __________________)
```

## Identifying unmatched values with `antijoin()`

‣ The `anti_join()` function in {dplyr} is another way to identify discrepancies

‣ It returns rows from the first dataframe where the key values **don't match** the second dataframe

‣ Let's find unmatched `state` values in `tb_notifs_public` compared to `covid_screening_public`

```{r, render = reactable_5_rows}
anti_join(________________, ________________)
```

‣ And vice versa, for values in `covid_screening_public` but not in `tb_notifs_public`:

```{r, render = reactable_5_rows}
anti_join(________________, ________________)
```

‣ This method provides more context for discrepancies

‣ After identifying, fix the errors with `mutate()` and proceed with the join

**PRACTICE TIME !**

::: practice
### Q: Check and fix typos before join {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The following dataframe, also taken from the [TB Report](https://data.gov.in/catalog/india-tuberculosis-report-2023), contains information on the number of pediatric TB cases and the number of pediatric patients initiated on treatment.

```{r message=FALSE, render = reactable_5_rows}
child <- read_csv(here("data/child_TB_india_modified.csv"))

child_public <- child %>% 
  filter(hc_type == "public") %>% 
  select(-hc_type)

child_public 
```

1.  Using `set_diff()` or `anti_join()` compare the key values from the `child_public` dataframe with those from the `tb_notifs_public` dataframe, which was defined previously
2.  Make any necessary changes to the `child_public` dataframe to ensure that the values match.
3.  Join the two datasets.
4.  Identify which two regions have the highest proportion of TB cases in children.
:::

## Real Data Example 2: Key Typos and Data Gaps

‣ **Key typos** and **formatting inconsistencies** can hinder successful joins between datasets.

‣ Let's explore a more complex scenario involving the `covid_screening_public` dataset.

```{r}
covid_screening_public
```

‣ Our goal is to enrich this dataset with **zoning information** from the `regions` dataset.

```{r}
regions <- read_csv(here("data/region_data_india.csv"))
regions
```

‣ Columns in `regions` include `zonal_council`, `subdivision_category`, and `state_UT`.

‣ We'll use a **left join** to merge without losing rows from `covid_screening_public`.

```{r}
covid_regions <- left_join(_____________, 
                           _____________, 
                           by = c("_____" = "________"))
covid_regions
```

‣ After the join, some entries are **missing zoning information**.

```{r}
covid_regions %>% 
  filter(is.na(zonal_council))
```

‣ To understand why, we'll investigate using `anti_join()`.

```{r}
anti_join(regi ons, covid_screening_public, by = c(______ = ______))
```

‣ 3 states are present in `regions` but absent in `covid_screening_public`.

‣ Now, let's reverse the check.

```{r}
anti_join(______, ______, by = c(______ = ______))
```

‣ Some mismatches are due to **key typos**, while others are **absent from the `regions` dataset**.

‣ To correct typos, we'll apply similar fixes as in a previous example.

```{r}
# Correct state typos:
covid_screening_public_fixed <- covid_screening_public %>% 
  mutate(state = 
           case_when(_____ == _____ ~ _____, 
                     TRUE ~ state))
```

‣ After applying the fixes, we perform another left join.

```{r}
covid_regions_joined_fixed <- left_join(______, 
                                        ______, 
                                        by = c(______ = ______))
covid_regions_joined_fixed
```

‣ Check for entries still missing zoning information.

```{r}
# Check for missing zonal council information again:
covid_regions_joined_fixed %>% 
  filter(is.na(zonal_council))
```

‣ Some regions were not included in the `regions` dataset.

‣ This example highlights the challenges of ensuring **no data loss during joins**.

**REMEMBER!**

‣ Correcting typographical errors for successful joins is a **complex task**.

‣ Fuzzy matching may be necessary for **imperfect string comparisons**.

‣ Explore the `{fuzzyjoin}` package in R for solutions.

### Q: Merging TB Cases with Geographic Data {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Run the code bellow to define two datasets.

The first, `top_tb_cases_kids` records the top 20 countries with the highest incidence of tub erculosis (TB) in children for the year 2012:

```{r, render = reactable_5_rows}
top_tb_cases_kids <- tidyr::who %>% 
  filter(year == 2012) %>% 
  transmute(country, iso3, tb_cases_smear_0_14 = new_sp_m014 + new_sp_f014) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tb_cases_smear_0_14)) %>% 
  head(20)

top_tb_cases_kids
```

And `country_regions` lists countries along with their respective regions and continents:

```{r, render = reactable_5_rows}
country_regions <- countrycode::codelist %>% 
  select(country_name = iso.name.en, iso3c, region) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(country_name, region))

country_regions
```

Your task is to augment the TB cases data with the region and continent information without losing any relevant data.

1.  Perform a `left_join` of `top_tb_cases_kids` with `country_regions` with the country names as the key. Identify which five countries fail to match correctly.

```{r eval = F}
left_join(top_tb_cases_kids, _______________________, by = __________)
```

2.  Using the code below, amend the country names in `top_tb_cases_kids` using `case_when` to rectify mismatches:

```{r}
top_tb_cases_kids_fixed <- top_tb_cases_kids %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(
    country == "Democratic Republic of the Congo" ~ "Congo, Democratic Republic of the",
    country == "Philippines" ~ "Philippines, The",
    country == "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" ~ "Korea, Democratic People's Republic of",
    country == "United Republic of Tanzania" ~ "Tanzania, United Republic of",
    country == "Cote d'Ivoire" ~ "Côte d'Ivoire",
    TRUE ~ country 
  ))

top_tb_cases_kids_fixed
```

Now attempt the join again using the revised dataset.

```{r eval = F}
left_join(top_tb_cases_kids_fixed, _______________________, by = __________)
```

3.  Try another `left_join`, but this time use the three-letter ISO code as the key. Do those initial five countries now align properly?

```{r eval = F}
left_join(top_tb_cases_kids, _______________________, by = __________)
```

4.  What is the advantage of utilizing ISO codes when recording and storing country information?
:::

## One-to-many relationships

‣ We've mainly looked at **one-to-one joins**.

‣ But what about **one-to-many joins**?

‣ Here, an observation in one dataframe corresponds to multiple observations in the other.

![The concept of one-to-many relationships](images/one_to_many.jpg)

‣ To illustrate, let's return to our patients and their COVID test data.

‣ Imagine `Alice` and `Xavier` got tested multiple times for COVID.

```{r}
test_info_many <- tribble(
  ~name,    ~test_date, ~result,
  "Alice",  "2023-06-05", "Negative",
  "Alice",  "2023-06-10", "Positive",
  "Bob",    "2023-08-10", "Positive",
  "Xavier", "2023-05-02", "Negative",
  "Xavier", "2023-05-12", "Negative",
)
```

‣ Let's see what happens when we use a `left_join()` with `demographic` as the dataset to the left of the call:

```{r}
left_join(demographic, test_info_many)
```

‣ Here's what happened:

‣ `Alice` was retained.

‣ But she featured twice in the right dataset, so her demographic information was duplicated in the final dataset.

‣ `Xavier` was dropped entirely.

‣ When performing a one-to-many join, the data from the "one" side is duplicated for each matching row of the "many" side.

### Q: Merging TB Cases with Geographic Data {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Copy the code below to create two small dataframes:

```{r}
patient_info <- tribble(
  ~patient_id, ~name,     ~age,
  1,          "Liam",     32,
  2,          "Manny",    28,
  3,          "Nico",     40
)

conditions <- tribble(
  ~patient_id, ~disease,
  1,           "Diabetes",
  1,           "Hypertension",
  2,           "Asthma",
  3,           "High Cholesterol",
  3,           "Arthritis"
)

```

If you use a `left_join()` to join these datasets, how many rows will be in the final dataframe? Try to figure it out and then perform the join to see if you were right!
:::

‣ Explore the `tb_notifs` dataset

```{r}
tb_notifs
```

‣ Note: Two rows per state, for public and private health facilities

‣ Second dataset: `regions` dataset, containing Indian state and Union Territories

```{r}
full_regions <- read_csv(here("data/region_data_india_full.csv"))
full_regions
```

‣ Let's try joining the datasets:

```{r}
notif_regions <- tb_notifs %>% 
  left_join(regions, by = c("state" = "state_UT"))
notif_regions
```

‣ Data from the `regions` dataframe was duplicated

## Multiple key columns

‣ Sometimes we have more than one column that uniquely identifies the observations that we want to match on.

‣ Consider systolic blood pressure measures for patients before and after a drug trial

```{r}
blood_pressure <- tribble(
  ~name,    ~time_point,  ~systolic, 
  "Alice",   "pre",         139,      
  "Alice",   "post",        121,      
  "Bob",     "pre",         137,      
  "Bob",     "post",        128,      
  "Charlie", "pre",         137,      
  "Charlie", "post",        130 )
```

‣ Another dataset contains serum creatinine levels for the same patients and time points

```{r}
kidney <- tribble(
  ~name,    ~time_point,  ~creatinine, 
  "Alice",   "pre",         0.84,      
  "Alice",   "post",        1.03,      
  "Bob",     "pre",         0.87,      
  "Bob",     "post",        1.21,      
  "Charlie", "pre",         0.88,      
  "Charlie", "post",        1.25 )
```

‣ Our goal: join two datasets so each patient has two rows, one for levels before the drug and one for levels after.

‣ First instinct: join on the patient's name.

‣ Let's try this out:

```{r}
bp_kidney_dups <- blood_pressure %>% 
  left_join(kidney, by = _____)
```

‣ Result: Duplicated rows, leading to four rows per person.

‣ "Many-to-many" relationship: A scenario we generally want to avoid!

‣ We also see two `time_point` columns differentiated by `.x` and `.y`.

‣ Instead, we should match on BOTH `name` and `time_point`.

‣ Use `c()` function to specify both column names.

```{r}
bp_kidney <- blood_pressure %>%
  left_join(kidney, by = c(______, ______))
```

‣ This gives us the desired outcome!

‣ Now, let's apply this to our `tb_notifs` and `covid_screening` datasets.

```{r}
tb_notifs
covid_screening
```

‣ Final dataframe goal: Two rows for each state, one for public and one for private sector data.

‣ Match on both `state` and `hc_type` using `c()` in the `by=` statement.

```{r}
notif_covid <- tb_notifs %>%
  left_join(covid_screening, by=c(______, ______))
notif_covid
```

‣ Success! We got the exact structure we wanted.

### Q: Joining three datasets, including one-to-many {.unlisted .unnumbered}

In this practice, you will join three datasets: `notif_covid`, `child`, and `regions`. Follow the steps below to ensure that no data is lost.

Follow these steps and fill in the blanked code fragments to complete the joining process.

1. Check for mismatches between `notif_covid` and `child` using `anti_join()`.

```{r eval=F}
# Check mismatches
anti_join(___________________)
anti_join(___________________)
```

2. Clean the mismatches in `child` by creating `child_fixed`. Use `case_when()` to update state names.

```{r eval=F}
# Clean mismatches
child_fixed <- child %>%
  mutate(state = case_when(
    state == "___________________" ~ "Arunachal Pradesh",
    state == "___________________" ~ "Jammu & Kashmir",
    state == "___________________" ~ "Kerala",
    state == "___________________" ~ "Puducherry",
    TRUE ~ state
  ))
```

3. Verify that the mismatches have been resolved using `anti_join()`. These should return empty dataframes.

```{r eval=F}
# Verify mismatches resolved
anti_join(child_fixed, notif_covid)
anti_join(notif_covid, child_fixed)
```

4. Join `notif_covid` and `child_fixed` using `left_join()` on `state` and `hc_type`. Assign the result to `join_1`.

```{r eval=F}
# Join notif_covid and child_fixed
join_1 <- notif_covid %>% 
  left_join(child_fixed, by = _____________)
```

5. Check for mismatches between `join_1` and `regions` using `anti_join()`.

```{r eval=F}
# Check mismatches
anti_join(join_1, regions, by = c("state" = "state_UT"))
anti_join(regions, join_1, by = c("state_UT" = "state"))
```

You may notice that some states, e.g. Ladakh, are missing from the `regions` dataset. There is nothing we can do about this for the moment, so we will proceed with the join.


6. Perform the final join using `left_join()` on `state` from `join_1` and `state_UT` from `regions`. Assign the result to `final_join`.

```{r eval=F}
# Final join
final_join <- join_1 %>% 
  left_join(___________________)
```

The question said to avoid losing information, so you may be wondering why we used a `left_join()` of a `full_join()`? The outputs are actually the same in this case. Remember that `left_join()` keeps all rows from the left dataset. The missing states we commented in step 5 are present in the left,  `join_1` dataset, so they are not lost in the final join. And when you can choose between `left_join()` and `full_join()`, it is better to use `left_join()` as it is easier for your audience to reason about what your code is doing.

7. Display the `final_join` dataset.

```{r eval=F}
# Display final_join
final_join
```

:::


# Wrap Up!

In this lesson, we delved into the intricacies of data cleaning before a join, focusing on how to detect and correct mismatches or inconsistencies in key columns. We also highlighted the impact of one-to-many relationships in joining dataframes, showing how data from the "one" side is duplicated for each matching row of the "many" side. Finally, we demonstrated how to join dataframes using multiple key columns.

As we conclude this lesson, we hope that you have gained a deeper understanding of the importance and utility of joining dataframes in R.

```{r, render = reactable_5_rows}
# 5 rows in the final dataframe
patient_info %>% 
  left_join(conditions)
```


### Q: Joining three datasets, including one-to-many {.unlisted .unnumbered}

1. Check for mismatches between `notif_covid` and `child` using `anti_join()`.

```{r}
# Check mismatches
anti_join(child, notif_covid)
anti_join(notif_covid, child)
```

2. Clean the mismatches in `child` by creating `child_fixed`. Use `case_when()` to update state names.

```{r}
# Clean mismatches
child_fixed <- child %>%
  mutate(state = case_when(
    state == "ArunachalPradesh" ~ "Arunachal Pradesh",
    state == "Jammu and Kashmir" ~ "Jammu & Kashmir",
    state == "kerala" ~ "Kerala",
    state == "Pondicherry" ~ "Puducherry",
    TRUE ~ state
  ))
```

3. Verify that the mismatches have been resolved using `anti_join()`.

```{r}
# Verify mismatches resolved
anti_join(child_fixed, notif_covid)
anti_join(notif_covid, child_fixed)
```

4. Join `notif_covid` and `child_fixed` using `left_join()` on `state` and `hc_type`. Assign the result to `join_1`.

```{r}
# Join notif_covid and child_fixed
join_1 <- notif_covid %>% 
  left_join(child_fixed, by = c("state", "hc_type"))
```

5. Check for mismatches between `join_1` and `regions` using `anti_join()`.

```{r}
# Check mismatches
anti_join(join_1, regions, by = c("state" = "state_UT"))
anti_join(regions, join_1, by = c("state_UT" = "state"))
```

You may notice that some states, e.g. Ladakh, which are present in `join_1` are missing from the `regions` dataset. There is nothing we can do about this for the moment, so we will proceed with the join.

6. Perform the final join using `left_join()` on `state` from `join_1` and `state_UT` from `regions`. Assign the result to `final_join`.

```{r}
# Final join
final_join <- join_1 %>% 
  left_join(regions, by = c("state" = "state_UT"))
```

The question said to avoid losing information, so you may be wondering why we used a `left_join()` of a `full_join()`? The outputs are actually the same in this case. Remember that `left_join()` keeps all rows from the left dataset. The missing states we commented in step 5 are present in the left,  `join_1` dataset, so they are not lost in the final join. And when you can choose between `left_join()` and `full_join()`, it is better to use `left_join()` as it is easier for your audience to reason about what your code is doing.

7. Display the `final_join` dataset.

```{r}
# Display final_join
final_join
```
